👋🏽 Welcome to my GitHub profile!


![gifgit (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/235c498f-2cb2-48e8-9a1c-178a57e7306b)
I'm here after finding myself becoming quite passionate about exploring the world of tech, coding, and all things creative. 🚀


## 🌟 About Me
- 🧠 **Learning**: Currently diving into coding,
PGP keys, encryption & decryption 🖥️


- 🛠️ **Interests**: Powershell, frequencies, and the amazing things one can do with a 'Flipper Zero' (within the law, of course 😉 I do actually warn, inform and advise the good folk about the vulnerabilities and dangers of the carelessness of personal security regarding modern and popular technology, i.e strengthening passwords etc).

- 🧑‍💻 **Fun Fact**: Australia is wider than the moon 🌙, and Earth spins at **1000 mph**, yet we don’t feel a thing! 🌏
